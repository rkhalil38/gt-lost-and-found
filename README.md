## üöÄ Overview

The app is a NextJS 13 application (built using create-next-app). GT Lost and Found is written in TypeScript and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. GT Lost and Found uses Supabase (a PostgreSQL alternative to Firebase) as its primary database and authenticator. Supabase utilizes Cookie-based authentication, meaning user's credentials are stored in cookies upon login.

## üíª Running Locally

### Required Software

- Node.js (any recent version will suffice)
- Node Package Manager (NPM) version 10.4 or later

### Important API Key Notice

- For the maps to properly display, a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) is required
- All other required API keys are supplied in `.env.example`

### Managing Dependencies and Environment Variables

After the repository is cloned to your local machine, run the following command in the repo folder:

```
npm install
```

Then run this command to copy the contents of .env.example to .env:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running the App

To start a local development version of the frontend app, run:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will then become viewable at http://localhost:3000, which can then be viewed in the browser.

With that, any changes in the frontend code should be hot-reloaded to localhost.

‚ÄºÔ∏è **WARNING**

When running the program, Next may throw errors in the bottom left relating to the Google Maps API. These can be safely ignored. In strict mode, React renders components twice upon the initial page load. This can cause some weird behaviors with the useEffect hook, throwing the errors. For more information, [click here.](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode)

### Linting and Formatting

GT Lost and Found uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and formatting through [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). The following commands should be run before committing.

**Run Prettier and Format Code**
```
npx prettier . --write
```

**Run ESLint (Raises Warnings and Errors)**
```
npm run lint
```
